# Federated Learning with Multi-head Attention Distillation for Interpretability on Heterogeneous Clients

## Introduction

this projects is the implementation of the paper [FedMHAD: Federated Learning with Multi-head Attention Distillation for Interpretability on Heterogeneous Clients]() in PyTorch.

## Install

install pytorch and torchvision from [official website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/) according to the CUDA and GPU settings for your PC.

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running code

execute "run.sh" file 

## Prepare Dataset

(will add prepare dataset code later)

## Results

| Method | Accuracy |
| :------- | --------:|
| FedAvg | - |
| FedDF | - |
| FedMHAD | - |
